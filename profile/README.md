# BrainAV: AI Creative Ecosystem

**BrainAV** is a creative technology lab building intelligent tools for the future of music.

## 🌌 The Ecosystem

We are developing a suite of distinct AI agents that cover the full spectrum of music:

### 1. The DJ Brain (Performance)
**"The AI that plays music."**
An intelligent DJ application designed to mix, curate, and perform. It handles the **playback** side of the equation—reading crowds, mixing tracks, and managing energy levels.

### 2. AI Co-Producer (Creation)
**"The AI that makes music."**
An executive producer for your DAW (starting with Ableton Live). It handles the **creation** side—generating MIDI, designing sounds, and arranging tracks via OSC (Open Sound Control).

### 3. Visuals (Add-on)
**"The AI that sees music."**
Future modules for AI-driven visual synthesis and live performance synchronization.

## 🛠 Technical Focus

- **Languages:** Python (AI/Backend), Node.js, C++.
- **Protocols:** OSC (Open Sound Control), MIDI.
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson.
