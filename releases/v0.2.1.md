# v0.2.1 - The Strategic Pivot (Pre-Site)

**Date:** 2025-12-20

## 🚀 Summary
This release marks the official internal strategic pivot of BrainAV from a DJ services agency to an **AI Tech Lab**. While the public-facing website (`index.html`) has not yet been refactored, the internal documentation, roadmap, and developer workflows have been completely overhauled to support the development of "The DJ Brain" and `ai-coproducer`.

## 📋 Changes

### 📚 Documentation & Strategy
- **Roadmap Pivot:** Updated `roadmap.md` to reflect the new product-focused mission, deprecating service-based goals.
- **New Workflow:** Created `CONTRIBUTING.md` to define the Python/OSC tech stack and contribution guidelines.
- **AI Context:** Created `prompt.md` to assist AI agents in understanding the new project scope and executing tasks autonomously.
- **Dev Guide:** Updated `AI_DEV_GUIDE.md` to align with the "AI Tech Lab" vision.
- **Ecosystem Definition:** Updated `README.md` and `profile/README.md` to distinguish between "The DJ Brain" (Performance) and "AI Co-Producer" (Creation).

### ⚙️ Internal Processes
- Added "Project Checkup" and "Agent Mode" task launchers to `prompt.md`.
- Established a structured release notes workflow in `.github/releases/`.

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Pending
- The landing page (`index.html`) still reflects the legacy DJ services brand. This will be addressed in the next release (Phase 0: Brand & Web Migration).
