# v0.2.3 - Ecosystem Expansion & Hub Identity

**Date:** 2026-01-02

## 🚀 Summary
This release solidifies the BrainAV ecosystem by formally introducing the **Flight Deck** and **Visuals** components, deploying the **Audio-Visualizer** prototype, and establishing `hub.brainav.ca` as the central ecosystem hub. It also marks the completion of the initial cPanel deployment for the main commercial site.
